Build the remaining SEO science and calculator pages planned in the development plan.

## Tasks

### Science Pages (`/science/`)
1. `/science/calculation-engine` — how the algorithm works
2. `/science/stack-and-reach` — stack and reach explained
3. `/science/bike-fit-methods` — comparison of fitting methods (LeMond, KOPS, retul, etc.)
