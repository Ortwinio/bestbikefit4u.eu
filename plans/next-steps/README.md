# Next Steps Plan

## Goal

Prioritized roadmap for BikeFit AI based on the architecture review findings. Organized into immediate fixes, short-term features, and medium-term development.

## Background

The architecture review (`context/architecture-review.md`) identified 10 issues across 4 severity levels. Since then, core recommendation mapping and initial test foundations have been implemented. This plan now tracks only the remaining product and content gaps.

## Ownership

## Scope

- Remaining bugfix and setup work
- Bikes frontend
- Measurement guide page
- PDF export
- SEO science/calculator pages

## Status: IN PROGRESS

3. **Keep dev plan status aligned** — documentation accuracy

### Short-Term (Next Sprint)
4. **Build bikes feature** — backend exists, needs frontend
5. **Implement PDF export** — enabled results artifact
6. **Keep legal/info pages maintained** — measurement guide delivered

### Medium-Term (Following Sprints)
7. **SEO science/calculator pages** — organic search traffic + reusable tools
