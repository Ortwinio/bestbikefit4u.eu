# Step 02: Rewrite Homepage Reasons and Value Proposition

## Objective

Shift homepage messaging from feature-led to outcome-led and make reasons to start bike fitting explicit.

## Inputs

- `src/i18n/messages/en.ts`
- `src/i18n/messages/nl.ts`
- `src/app/(public)/page.tsx`

## Tasks

1. Replace generic hero text with benefit-first language.
2. Add a dedicated section: "Why start bike fitting now?" with top reasons:
   - pain reduction (knees, neck, hands, lower back)
   - more power and efficiency
   - better comfort on long rides
   - injury risk reduction and consistency
   - better bike control/confidence
3. Rework CTAs per funnel stage:
   - Primary: start free fit
   - Secondary: see how it works / examples
4. Add trust proof blocks (methodology, rider outcomes, transparent limitations).

## Deliverable

- Updated EN/NL homepage copy architecture
- New reasons-to-start section with clear conversion intent

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Hero clearly communicates who it is for and the outcome.
- [ ] Reasons-to-start section exists in EN and NL.
- [ ] CTA labels match intent and are consistent site-wide.
- [ ] Copy is scannable and non-repetitive.
