## Voice and Tone

### English

- Outcome-first and practical.
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Prefer concrete adjustments over abstract claims.
- Be explicit about limitations when relevant.

### Dutch

- Natural Dutch sentence flow; avoid literal translation from English.
- Keep technical terms only where they are common in cycling (e.g., reach, stack, stuurdrop).
- Use concise, direct phrasing aimed at action.

## Page-Level Copy Rules

1. Start with rider outcomes before method details.
2. Use consistent CTA phrasing:
   - EN: `Start Free Fit`
   - NL: `Start gratis fit`
3. Keep conversion language concrete (what the rider gets, and when).
4. Avoid repetitive "science-based" claims without context.
5. Keep one primary intent per section.
